# Voice Cloning Knowledge Distillation

This repository is a work in progress, the models are big in size so difficulty in uploading, all samples are yet to be added.

This repository contains a research project focusing on **voice cloning** using **knowledge distillation techniques**. The main goal is to distill knowledge from a large teacher model (a high-quality, resource-intensive voice cloning system) into a smaller, more efficient student model without significantly compromising audio quality and speaker similarity.

By using knowledge distillation, we aim to reduce the computational footprint, memory usage, and inference latency of state-of-the-art voice cloning models, making them more accessible and deployable on edge devices or less powerful hardware setups.

## Key Features

- **Knowledge Distillation Pipeline:**  
  Leverages a high-fidelity teacher TTS (Text-to-Speech) model to train a smaller student model. The student model learns to replicate the teacher’s acoustic output and voice characteristics.
  
- **Multi-Speaker Voice Cloning:**  
  Works with multiple target speakers, allowing the student model to generalize and clone various voices.
  
- **Lightweight & Efficient:**  
  Optimized for lower computational cost while preserving voice quality and naturalness.

- **Famous Speaker Samples:**  
  Includes demonstration samples for notable voices such as:
  - Donald Trump
  - Elon Musk
  - Jensen Huang
  - Barack Obama

  These samples showcase the model’s ability to capture distinctive speaking styles, intonations, and vocal timbre.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **PyTorch 1.10+** (GPU recommended for training)
- **Audio Processing Libraries:**  
  Such as `librosa`, `soundfile`
- **Model Dependencies:**  
  Requirements might differ based on the teacher and student architectures chosen. Install dependencies via:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running the Training

1. **Prepare Data:**  
   Ensure `data/` contains aligned text and corresponding teacher model outputs.  
   If not already present, generate teacher outputs:
   ```bash
   python scripts/synthesize.py --model teacher_model --text data/text_prompts.txt --output data/teacher_audio/
   ```

2. **Run Distillation:**  
   Train the student model using:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_distillation.py --teacher models/teacher_model --output models/student_model
   ```

   Adjust hyperparameters, batch size, and learning rate as needed within the script or via command-line arguments.

### Inference & Audio Generation

After training completes, you can generate audio samples using the student model:

```bash
python scripts/synthesize.py --model models/student_model --text data/text_prompts.txt --output data/student_output/
```

Check the `data/student_output/` directory for new audio files.

### Evaluation

We provide a basic set of evaluation metrics, including mel-cepstral distortion (MCD), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and speaker verification embeddings. To run evaluation:

```bash
python scripts/evaluation_metrics.py --teacher data/teacher_audio/ --student data/student_output/
```

This will print out quality and similarity metrics. Adjust code as needed to integrate with your preferred evaluation pipeline.

## Generated Audio Samples

In the [`samples/` directory](samples/), you will find example audio clips generated by the student model for well-known voices. These samples demonstrate how closely the student model can mimic the teacher’s output and speaker characteristics after distillation:

- [Trump Sample](samples/trump_samples/)
- [Elon Musk Sample](samples/elon_musk_sample.wav)
- [Jensen Huang Sample](samples/jensen_huang_sample.wav)
- [Obama Sample](samples/obama_sample.wav)

Listen to these samples to get a sense of the quality and capabilities of the distilled model.

## Limitations & Ethical Considerations

- **Voice Cloning Misuse:**  
  The ability to clone voices raises ethical and privacy concerns. Use responsibly, only for legally and ethically permissible scenarios.
  
- **Impersonation Risks:**  
  Generated voices can be misused for impersonation or misinformation. Consider watermarking or implementing authentication measures if deploying publicly.

- **Data & Licensing:**  
  Ensure that you have proper rights and licenses for any training data used, especially if dealing with proprietary speech datasets.
